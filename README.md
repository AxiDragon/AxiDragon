### One game-designer-coding-dragon band!

A couple years ago, I started out as a Game Artist on the University of Arts Utrecht.
Since then, I got in touch with coding in Processing, Unity, and also various aspects of web development!
So, half a year in, I switched over to Game Design, to get myself more immersed in code and all its shenanigans. 
Now, I love making a variety of programs to make life just a little better. Even if the time it takes me to make the program is far more than the time it'll actually save me, of course.

I'm hoping to land myself a job in IT later!
